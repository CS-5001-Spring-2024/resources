Exam 2 Study Guide
==================

## Logistics

Exam 2 will take place in person on Wednesday, March 20 from 6-7:40pm. It will be 8-14 questions in length. 

You **may** use resources including the Python interpreter, your notes, and online resources that you would use for your homework assignments. 

You **may not** submit code that has been copied from or generated by any other source, human or AI. Examples of tools that you may not use include but are not limited to:

- LLMs including Chat GPT and Bard
- Auto-complete tools including GitHub co-pilot and replit
- Your classmates
- Friends you contact via text, email, or a messaging app

You may not copy any part of any answer from any other resource. Any resources used (e.g., a StackOverflow post) must be cited.

## Question Format

Here is some general guidance about the kinds of questions to expect:

- Several questions will ask you to write methods or functions.
- You may be required to raise exceptions, instantiate objects, and call methods on objects.
- You may be required to build dictionaries, iterate over dictionaries, add data to dictionaries, or access data stored in dictionaries.
- You may be required to work with multi-dimensional lists. It is advised that you review your sudoku project to make sure you can implement algorithms that operate on matrices.

## Topics

The exam may cover any topics we have discussed this semester. It is recommended that you review the Exam 1 study guide as well. Topics include but are not limited to the following:

* Recursion
  - Given a recursive function, describe what it does
  - Given a recursive function, identify the base case
  - Given a recursive function, describe how the recursive call makes progress toward the base case
  - Identify and fix a bug in a recursive function
  - Write a recursive function to solve a given problem
* Errors/Error Handling
  - Use try/except to handle an error
  - Write a function that raises errors
* Dictionaries
  - Insert a new item into a dictionary
  - Determine if a value exists in a dictionary
  - Find a data item stored in a dictionary
* Classes
  - Create an instance of a class
  - Call a method on an object

## Example Problems

**Question 1**
Write a function called validation that behaves as follows:

Function: validation
   perform multiplication with different types
Parameters:
   one. an negative integer value
   two. a positive floating point number less than 1000
Returns the product of the two parameter values

The function will raise an error if one is not a negative integer or if two is not a postive floating point numebr less than 1000.

**Question 2**
Write a function called get\_key\_string that receives a dictionary and returns the keys of the dictionary as a string separated by the character '-'.

**Question 3**
Write a function called initialize that creates and returns a dictionary that contains the following data:

|Keys| Values	                    |
|---|----------------------------|
| Maria | Associate Professor |
| Jodi | Associate Dean of Network Programs |
| Beth | Dean of Khoury |

**Question 4**

```python
class Pair:

	def __init__(self, x, y):
		self.x = x
		self.y = y	
				
	def sum(self):
		return self.x + self.y
```

Given the class definition above write a code fragment that does the following:

1. Create an instance of Pair
2. Call the sum method and print the result

**Question 5**
Write a recursive function ```check_wordle``` that takes as input a wordle word and a guess and returns the number of *green* letters -- that is, the number of letters that are the same letter in the same position in both the wordle word and the guess.
