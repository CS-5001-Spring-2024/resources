## Example Problems

**Question 1**

Consider the following code fragment:

```python
fruit = "banana"
date = 1973
print(f"Your fruit is {fruit}. The year is {date}.")

animal = "dog"
score = 95.4
print(f"Your {animal} scored a {score}.")
 
response = "34"
print(f"You said {response}.")

```
For all variables created in the code fragment above list their name and type.


**Question 2**

What is the output of the following code fragment?

```python
a = 55
b = 5
c = a / b
print(c)
d =  a // 10
print(d)
e = 10 * b
print(e)
```

**Question 3**

What is the output of the following code fragment?

```python
string1 = "banana"
string2 = "apple"
integer1 = 42
integer2 = 987

if (string1 > string2) or (integer1 > integer2):
	print("tiger")
elif (integer1 == integer2) and (string2 > string1):
	print("giraffe")
elif integer2 > integer1:
	print("hyena")

if string2 > string1:
	if integer1 > integer2:
		print("hippo")
	else:
		print("elephant")
else:
	print("bear")
```

**Question 4**

There are two significant errors in the following code fragment. Identify at least one of them and describe it in detail.

```python

def function_one(param1):
	var1 = "cat"
	var2 = "dog"
	print(var1 + var2)

def function_two(param1):
	function_one()
	print(var1)

def main():
	function_two("test")

main()
```


**Question 5**

Write a function called check\_wordle\_guess that takes as input two strings -- a wordle word and a user guess at the wordle word. Return the number of characters that match, i.e., would be colored green in the wordle game. Return -1 if the words are not the same length. Examples:

	input1 = cow; input2 = cat; output = 1
	input1 = cow; input2 = bird; output = -1
	input1 = kitten; input2 = kitten; output = 6
	input1 = dog; input2 = dig; output = 2

**Question 6**

Consider the following Python function:

```python
def sleep_in(weekday, vacation):
	'''
	Returns True if we can sleep in and False if not
	Parameters
	weekday: boolean
		True if it is a weekday and False if not
	vacation: boolean
		True if it is a vacation day and False if not
	Returns:
	boolean
		True if we can sleep in and False if not
	'''
	
	if not weekday or vacation:
		return True
	return False
```

Write at least three test cases that would test different possible execution paths of this function. A test case will be a call to the function with appropriate parameters. *For each test case, briefly describe what the case tests.*

**Question 7**

Consider the following code fragment:

```python
index = 0
string = "a"
while index < 10:
	if len(string) % 2 == 0:
		print(string)
	string = string + "a"
	index += 1
```

(a) What is the name of the control variable for this loop?

(b) What would be the output of this loop?

**Question 8**

Write a Python function that will take as input two lists of integers -- list1 and list2 -- and will return a new list where the value at position i of the new list will be the value at position i of list1 plus the value at position i of list2.

**Question 9**

What is the output of the following code fragment?

```python
string = "one two three four"
result = ""
for letter in string:
	if letter == "t" or letter == " ":
		result = result + "-"
	elif letter == "e":
		result = result + "$"
	else:
		result = result + letter
print(result)
``` 

**Question 10**

```python
def mystery(n):
	if n == 1:
		return 1
	return n + mystery(n-1)

```

Given the code above, answer the following questions:

1. What does the function do? Provide an English explanation of the behavior.
2. What is the base case of the function?
3. What would the output be if the function were called as follows: mystery(-3)?

**Question 11**

```python
def print_string_backward(string):
	"""
	Implement a recursive function that takes as input a str and prints 
	the characters of the str *in reverse* one per line *without using a loop*. 
	"""
	if len(string) == 1:
		return

	print_string_backward(string[1:])
	print(string[0])
```

Identify the bug in the function above. For full credit, your solution must (1) describe the bug in English and (2) provide the modified code that would fix the bug.

**Question 12**
Given a string, compute recursively a new string where all the 'x' chars have been removed.

**Question 13**
Given a non-negative int n, return the sum of its digits recursively (no loops). 

sum\_digits(126) → 9; sum\_digits(49) → 13; sum\_digits(12) → 3

**Question 14**
Write a function called validation that behaves as follows:

Function: validation
   perform multiplication with different types
Parameters:
   one. an negative integer value
   two. a positive floating point number less than 1000
Returns the product of the two parameter values

The function will raise an error if one is not a negative integer or if two is not a postive floating point number less than 1000.
